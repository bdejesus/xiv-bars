        How To Use This Planner

      <p>
        Creating the perfect hotbar interface setup in Final Fantasy XIV using a controller is clunky and time-consuming. This simulator allows you to plan out your hotbar layouts using a web-based drag-and-drop interface to simulate different configurations before commiting it to your controller HUD in-game.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <h5>Select a FFXIV Class/Job</h5>
          <p>
            Choose from and plan your hotbars for any of the FFXIV Class/Jobs
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h5>Toggle between FFXIV Hotbar layouts</h5>
          <p>
            Simulate either a W Cross Hotbar (WXHB) or standard Hotbars layout.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h5>Drag &amp; Drop Actions to Slots</h5>
          <p>
            Slot any of the Combat and Role actions for your selected Class/Job, as well as any Menu Command, Macros, and other Actions.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h5>Export to a Macro and Share With Others</h5>
          <p>
            Once youâ€™re done configuring your Final Fantasy XIV hotbar layout, save or share your layout with the generated URL. You can also export your layout to a macro that you can use to import your layout into the game.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
