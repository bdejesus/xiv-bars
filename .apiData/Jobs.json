Dubbed somanoutics, the art seeks to heal and protect by manipulating corporeal aether through the use of nouliths, a flying array of foci. Practitioners are dedicated to the betterment of mankind, and for their wisdom and compassion, eventually came to be known simply as sages."},{"Abbreviation":"RPR","Abbreviation_ja":"RPR","ClassJobParent":null,"ID":39,"Name":"Reaper","Name_ja":"リーパー","Icon":"/cj/1/reaper.png","Url":"/ClassJob/39","Abbr":"RPR","Discipline":"DOW","Role":"PDPS","ClassID":null,"Weapon":"Scythe","Description":"The Garleans’ forebears were once humble farmers who made their home among the sun-drenched fields of southern Ilsabard. That was, until they were driven from this paradise by invaders wielding arcane magicks. Forced north into the frigid mountains, the survivors sought a means to tap into the reservoir of aether otherwise closed to them.

Once more they took up their scythes, this time to reap a crimson harvest."}]
